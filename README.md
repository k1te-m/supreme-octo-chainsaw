  ## Description
  A react application that acts as the main portfolio for my coding projects. The site relies on MongoDB to store information about the different portfolio items and receive messages from visitors. StyledComponents and Framer-Motion were used for ease of CSS and animations. I wanted to rebuild my prior portfolio using some of the new skills I had learned over the past several months. I look forward to continuing to update as I learn more!
